            <p class="first-comment">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>

               <q>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I 've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course an found it incredibly fub! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most qrueling - time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. </q>

            <p class="first-comment">Such a life-changing experience. highly recommended!</p>
            <p class="second-comment">
               <q>Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals enroll by a former student of theirs whocan only say wonderful things about the program. 
                  The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hadns-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. 
                  The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                  Infact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.
                  It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. !00% recommended!

            <p class="second-comment">
               <q>The staff seem qenuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard as above the rest. you will get the personal attention you need from an increadible community of smart and amazing people</q>
